# Research
# A repository for the files I have used in my research. 
# Not all of this is perfectly up to date, since I do not make a consistent effort to maintain this on a daily basis.

Once each paper is accepted for publication, I will place the newest and relevant code up here. Code pertaining to active reseach can be requested at randall.reese@inl.gov. 

My doctoral dissertation is uploaded as a PDF (dissert.pdf). 
This version of the disseration contains the R code that was removed for publication with Utah State University.

I also have uploaded a paper on the translation of the Bible into Korean. I am actually one of the leading authorities in the world on the translation of the Bible into Korean. (Suprising!)
