# Research
# A repository for the files I have used in my research. 
# Not all of this is perfectly up to date, since I do not make a consistent effort to maintain this on a daily basis.

Once each paper is accepted for publication, I will place the newest and relevant code up here. Code pertaining to active reseach can be requested at randall.reese@aggiemail.usu.edu. (i.e. for employment purposes). 

I also have uploaded a paper on the translation of the Bible into Korean. I am actually one of the leading authorities in the world on the translation of the Bible into Korean. (Suprising!)
